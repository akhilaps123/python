#  You are managing a small grocery store. You keep lists of items sold in three sections: fruits, vegetables, and beverages.
# Create separate lists for each section with at least 3 items.
# Add a new item to the fruits list.
# Insert a new item at the second position of the vegetables list.
# Remove the last item from the beverages list.
# Combine all three lists into a nested list called inventory.
# Use slicing to print only the first two fruits.
# Use negative indexing to access the last item from the vegetables list.
# Create a list of lengths of all items in the fruits list using list comprehension.
# Check if "Water" is in the beverages list.
# Finally, create a tuple of the first item from each section.
